            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:125641:3"/>ſure I am, you have their marrow and ſubſtance, how defective ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in Quotations and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. I know my attempt will bee cenſured by the Learned, for bringing him abroad in ſo home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a dreſſe, who was the <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> of his time: But I choſe rather to bee cenſured by them, then to engroſſe a treaſure to my ſelfe, which by the bleſsing of God may enrich many: The benefit I reaped by him, the honour I owe unto his memory, and the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of friends, are a ſufficient Apology for my raſh adventure. That which I have brought to light, is but the work of five dayes; To what a vaſt volume would it riſe, if the elaborate Sermons which hee preached for above
<pb facs="tcp:125641:3"/>thirty years together, ſhould come to ſee the Sunne? I am bold to ſpeak it, becauſe I have hundreds to beare me witneſſe; he was as faithfull and conſtant a Labourer in Gods Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard as any the Kingdome had. VVhat remaines then, but our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to bee bettered by his holy Doctrine and godly Example, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the end of his converſation? My prayer to the moſt High is, that this Reverend Author may prove a <hi>Bonaerges,</hi> a Sonne of thunder, to rouſe and awaken the ſecure ſinner, but a <hi>Barnabas,</hi> a Sonne of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the Mourners in Zion: And if this taſte of his Miniſtery ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe good effects in any, I not only have my deſire, but if God ſo pleaſe, (not being prevented by others) I ſhall hereafter aſſay to give
<pb facs="tcp:125641:4"/>you a deeper draught of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Labours. Thus wiſhing thee as much comfort in peruſing them, as I had in hearing and tranſcribing them, I leave thee and them to the bleſsing of God, and bid thee fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur Text is part of the prayer and confeſſion of <hi>Ezra,</hi> the occaſion whereof was this; That holy man being returned from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> with men, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and great encouragement, he is welcomed by a ſad meſſage from the principall in Iſrael; they complaine, that the people of Iſrael, the Prieſts and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, had not ſeparated themſelves from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:125641:5"/>of the lands, doing according to their abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations: the hearing of this cauſed much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in good <hi>Ezra,</hi> that he ſhould come ſo farre, and finde
<hi>Paganiſme</hi> in <hi>Iudea;</hi> therefore like a diſtracted man, he rends his cloathes, teares the haire off this head and beard, and ſits downe aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: all which is but a fair preface to the prayer he makes; wherein, as if his heart were poured out in devotion, he profeſſeth that he is aſhamed to lift up his face to God, and confeſſeth the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of the people, acknowledging that God had been juſt in puniſhing them; <hi>And now, O our God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what ſhall wee ſay after this? thou haſt worthily plagued us, for wee have forſaken thy Commandements.</hi> Theſe three verſes are a part of his prayer, the ſubſtance whereof is an argument which he makes for God againſt themſelves, and it ſtands thus; <hi>Thoſe whom thou haſt delivered out of ſervitude and bondage, if they ſhall againe provoke thee by their rebellions, they deſerve to be conſumed;</hi> but this is the ſtate of Iſrael, <hi>thou O Lord haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered Iſrael out of captivity and thraldome, and yet they have rebelled againſt thee; therefore they deſerve to have no more favour ſhewed them, but to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and utterly conſumed.</hi> Our courſe in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe verſes ſhall be this: In them I propound two things to your consideration; firſt an Indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preferred by
<hi>Ezra</hi> againſt Iſrael: ſecondly, his pleading it for God againſt themſelves. In the firſt he remembers Gods mercy, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: Gods mercy is laid downe in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verſe, and that three wayes: firſt he ſhewes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:125641:5"/>that they were not puniſhed without cauſe: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that God puniſhed them leſſe then they deſerved: thirdly, that he had totally delivered them. Their rebellion is compriſed in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verſe, in which there are two parts; firſt the ſinne, ſecondly the puniſhment: the ſinne is laid downe, firſt generally, <hi>ſhould we againe break thy Commandements?</hi> ſecondly particularly, <hi>and joyne in affinity with the people of theſe abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi> Then followes the puniſhment; firſt, <hi>God will be angry:</hi> ſecondly there is the degree of his anger, <hi>he will not leave conſuming till all be deſtroyed.</hi> This is the carriage of the three verſes; in the opening of which, we ſhall ſee that they ſute us in this Land as well as any people under heaven: for considering that God did lately ſcourge us by the peſtilence, and of his meere mercy removed it totally from us; ſeeing wee have revived our ſinnes, and renewed our provocations againſt his majeſty, if he begin againe to renew his plagues, and ſcourge us till he have conſumed us, we muſt juſtifie him in his proceedings, who is righteous in all his wayes, and holy in all his works. Before we handle the particulars as we laid them downe, there be two things in generall which offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be diſcuſſed: the firſt is out of the party, which was <hi>Ezra;</hi> the ſecond is out of the courſe he takes, and that is humbling himſelfe in Gods preſence. Firſt for the party, it is <hi>Ezra;</hi> yee ſhall read in this book that he was a man that ſet his heart to ſeek the Lord, neither did he this only himſelfe, but ſought by all poſſible meanes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:125641:6"/>others to follow his godly example. Had all Iſrael beene ſuch as he, they needed not to have feared judgements comming upon them; but they were not, therefore ſeeing the ſinnes of the Land, hee could not forbeare, but breaks forth into lamentation and mourning; which affords us this point of Doctrine.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:125641:11"/>repine: whereas if a man looked up to God in what he ſuffers, he would ſay as <hi>Eli, It is the Lord let him doe what hee will,</hi> and with <hi>Iob, The Lord gives and takes, and bleſſed bee his Name:</hi> Nay, if a man would doe this, it would not only make him patient, but to profit by his affliction; for no man ſees himſelf ſo clearly and truly as in the glaſſe of adverſity; every affliction that God laies upon us ſeemes to ſay as
<hi>Ehud</hi> to <hi>Eglon, I have a meſſage to thee from God,</hi> which if a man would conſider, it would make his affliction a <hi>Betheſda,</hi> to cure him of his ſpirituall infirmities, and by ſo doing, hee would come out of that fornace, cleare gold, purged from the droſſe of his corruptions.</p>

                     <p>O Lord God of Iſrael, thou art righteous, for we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine yet eſcaped as it is this day: Behold wee are before thee in our treſpaſſes; for wee cannot ſtand before thee, becauſe of this.</p>

               <p>IN this verſe <hi>Ezra</hi> pleads guilty to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement, acknowledging God to bee juſt, though hee ſhould renew his judgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh upon them: There bee two things in it; Firſt, his juſtifying God, in theſe words, <hi>[O Lord God of Iſrael, thou art righteous.]</hi> Secondly, the reaſon which hee gives for it; firſt on Gods part, he had uſed all poſſible meanes to bring them to Reformation: <hi>[Wee remaine yet eſcaped as at this day:]</hi> ſecondly on their part, <hi>[they were ſtill in their treſpaſſes.]</hi> And therefore they were the freſh fuell of Gods indignation. Before we come to theſe particulars, give me leave to ſpeak a word or two of the ſtile hee gives God; he calls him, <hi>[Lord God of Iſrael.]</hi> The title <hi>[Lord,]</hi> ſignifies
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:125641:33"/>his greatneſſe, <hi>[the God of Iſrael,]</hi> his goodneſſe: A fit Preface for a prayer: for the word <hi>[Lord,]</hi> it is a terme well befitting God; in the holy Scripture he is ſaid to be <hi>ſtrong in power, and wonderfull in working:</hi> Nay, ſo powerfull he is, that nothing whatſoever is impoſſible to him: The Scripture demonſtrates further, That <hi>he doth what he pleaſeth, in heaven and in earth, in the ſeas, and all deep places, Pſal.</hi> 135.6. And what hee will doe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſa.</hi> 135.6.</note> all the world cannot hinder. Secondly, the holy Scripture ſets out Gods power by this, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hee doth, hee doth without difficulty: hee knowes how to ſit ſtill and work, and to work and ſit ſtill; Yea, ſo farre is his power extended, that his will is his power, as appeares in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>he ſaid the word, and all things were created:</hi> and though ſome Atheiſticall ſpirits have asked with what ladders and engines, God built the Fabrick of heaven; if they had but conſulted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. they ſhould have been reſolved;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1.</note> for that ſhewes them, that by his word ſpeaking all things were made: and it is worth our obſervation in the Book of God, where hee is ſaid to effect things by meanes; we ſhall finde <hi>that he hath done the greateſt things by the ſmalleſt meanes:</hi> Thus by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> a couple of poore men, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, in ſpight of
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> that great Potentate; and by <hi>Gideon</hi> and his three hundred men, hee conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that great Army of the <hi>Midianites</hi> which lay as as Graſſe-hoppers on the earth for mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: So he ruined the Walls of <hi>Iericho</hi> by the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:125641:34"/>ſound of rammes hornes; and he wrought thoſe great wonders in
<hi>Egypt</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> his rod, which was a contemptible thing: This alſo by
<hi>Shamgars</hi> goad hee laid the <hi>Philistims</hi> heapes upon heapes: and by a jawbone of an Aſſe in the hand of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> he ſlew a thouſand men; and by little
<hi>David</hi> overcame and ſlew that great <hi>Goliath:</hi> When hee would work redemption for the Sons of men, hee brought it to paſſe by him who was, <hi>noviſsimus hominum, the meaneſt of men:</hi> who was poore in his birth, obſcure in his educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, poorely attended when he came to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his Miniſtry, and pooreſt of all in his death, for <hi>qui in vita non domicilium, in morte non ſepulchrum, he that in his life had not a houſe to hide his head in, when hee died, was buried in another mans Tombe:</hi> and when hee will diſpence the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, hee makes choyce of Fiſhermen, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh thoſe glad tidings to the World. Thirdly, God is ſaid to bee powerfull, becauſe he can doe more then he will: he could <hi>of ſtones have raiſed children to Abraham,</hi> but hee would not; and when our bleſſed Lord was apprehended, hee tells <hi>Peter,</hi> that hee could have obtained of his Father, <hi>more then twelve legions of Angels to help him,</hi> but he would not: He can doe more then hee will, but hee will not doe all that hee can.</p>

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee is the God of <hi>Iſrael, ſecundum ſpecialem curam, in regard of that ſpeciall care hee had of them:</hi> he was a wall of fire round about them, to preſerve them from their enemies: God is ſaid to carry his people, as an Eagle carrieth her young ones on her wings,<note place="margin">

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:125641:35"/>but by his permiſſion. Thirdly, hee is the God of <hi>Iſrael, ſecundum ſpeciale praemium, by a ſpeciall reward which hee hath promiſed them:</hi> he ſaith to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> I am thy exceeding great reward; and that God that told him hee would give the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to him and his ſeed for a poſſeſſion, doth not only provide for his people a temporall <hi>Canaan</hi> here, but an eternall <hi>Canaan</hi> hereafter, of which the other is but a Tipe: they be called, <hi>ſegullam, his chiefe treaſure:</hi> and Saint

                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:125641:45"/>ſaith, this was the reaſon why the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Monkes made ſhort prayers, leſt they ſhould loſe their fervency by praying long: And here under this will come in, <hi>intention</hi> in prayer, which is when a man minds what hee prayes; and though
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſay, that a vertuall intention is enough, without an actuall; yet
<hi>Gregory,</hi> and I, ask him or any ſuch, this queſtion, why ſeeks he to bee heard of God, when hee heares not himſelfe? when a man doth perfunctorily ſlubber over his prayers, how ſhould hee look for a comfortable return of his petitions? the bullet can flie no further then the quantity of powder, wherewith the piece was charged, can carry it: and it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible our prayers ſhould reach heaven, unleſſe fervency goe along with them. Thirdly, we muſt pray <hi>faithfully,</hi> that is, believing wee ſhall receive what wee implore God for, if it bee according to his will:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.5.6.7.</note> ſaith S. <hi>Iames, Iam.</hi> 1.5.6.7. <hi>If any of you lack wiſedome, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and it ſhall be given him: but let him ask in faith, nothing wavering, for he that wavereth, is like a wave of the Sea, driven with the winde and toſſed: neither let that man think, that he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord:</hi> And in Chap. 5.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.15.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up: and if hee have committed ſinnes they ſhall bee forgiven him.</hi> Fourthly, wee muſt pray
<hi>conſtantly;</hi> this is that which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our commends to us from the importunity of the poore women, who would not ceaſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the unjuſt Iudge, till hee had granted her
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:125641:45"/>requeſt and done her juſtice: this alſo is that which the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> meanes, when hee ſaith, <hi>continue in prayer, Coloſ.</hi> 4.2. to wit, that men ſhould bee importunate with God in prayer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 4.2.</note> and if any man think it ill manners to be ſollicitous in preſſing God by prayer, <hi>Gregory</hi> tels him, it is a good violence, and affects God, who loves that his ſervants ſhould take the Kingdome of heaven by force. Further, there be two other things to be obſerved in our prayers; Firſt, <hi>Wee muſt aime at the glory of God in all the prayers wee make:</hi> This our bleſſed Lord teacheth us in that abſolute forme of prayer, which hee hath left us, the firſt petition whereof is, <hi>[hallowed by thy name.]</hi> The glory of God muſt be preferred before all things; yea, before the ſalvation of our ſoules, as we ſee in the examples of
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> who choſe rather to have their names raſed out of Gods book, then that hee ſhould loſe his glory in the ſalvation of his people. Therefore when a man is in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee ought to pray to God to deliver him, but for this end, that hee may live to glorifie him: This was the end of good <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> requeſt, when God ſent him word by
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> that hee had added fifteene yeares to his life, ſaith hee, <hi>What is the ſigne that I ſhall goe up to the houſe of the Lord?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi>
38.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.22. as if hee deſired health upon no other condition, but that hee might glorifie God in his Sanctuary. Secondly, a man muſt ſo pray to God, <hi>that withall hee uſe meanes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his deſires:</hi> This is the adviſe of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 2.3.4.5. <hi>If thou cryest after knowledge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 2
4.3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:125641:46"/>lifteſt up thy voice for underſtanding: if thou ſeekeſt her as ſilver, and ſearcheſt for her as for hid Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; then ſhalt thou underſtand the feare of the Lord, and finde the knowledge of God:</hi> There yee ſee that crying and calling, ſeeking and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, muſt goe together: and in vaine doſt thou pray to God, if thou follow not thy prayers with thy endeavours, for the attaining of that for which thou art a petitioner: as for example, thou prayeſt to be delivered from thy filthy exceſſe, but unleſſe thou ſtrive to forſake it, thou wilt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bee rid of that filthy vice: to doe otherwiſe is to bee like the man in the Apologue, who when his Cart ſtuck in the mire, prayed to <hi>Hercules</hi> for help, but never ſet to his ſhoulder to lift it out.</p>
               <p>If wee lay the men of theſe dayes to this ſquare,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> wee ſhall finde them to fall very ſhort of what wee have ſaid; doe the pray ſenſibly? Alas, when they pray, their hearts like <hi>Nabals,</hi> bee as dead in them as ſtones. Secondly, doe the pray fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently? alas no, for their prayers bee even key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cold. Thirdly, pray they conſtantly? O no, they deſiſt and are ſoone weary, they would have God preſently to heare them, but they will not ſtay his leaſure. Fourthly, doe they pray in faith? Alas, they have no promiſes to lay hold on. Againe, doe men ayme at Gods glory in their prayers? And doe they uſe the meanes to accompliſh their prayers? I am perſwaded theſe bee things ſcarſe thought of, much leſſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, but by a few: well, let us obſerve the true
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:125641:46"/>properties of ſupplication, and wee ſhall finde to our comfort, that hee is a God hearing prayers, and if hee pleaſe not to give us the very individuall things which we beg of him, yet wee ſhall have ſomething that is as good or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for us, ſo as hee ſhall bee glorified and wee comforted: So much for <hi>Ezra</hi> his firſt act. The ſecond act performed by him is his confeſſion, the Text ſaith, <hi>[when hee had confeſſed.] Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, confeſſion is twofold, <hi>confeſsio laudis, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of prayſe,</hi> and
<hi>confeſsio fraudis, a confeſsion of ſinne:</hi> Firſt, there is <hi>confeſsio laudis, a confeſsion of prayſe,</hi> ſuch was that of our Saviour Chriſt, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25.
<hi>I thank thee O Father Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth,</hi>

11.25.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them to babes.</hi> The ſecond is, <hi>confeſsio fraudis, the confeſſion of a mans ſinne,</hi> and this is either publike or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate: Firſt, publike, when the Miniſter goes before in confeſſing ſinne, and all the people follow after him; this is the cuſtome of our and all reformed Churches. Secondly, there is a private confeſſion, and that is of a particular man, and this is foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; Firſt, when hee confeſſes his ſinne to God, as did <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 32.5. ſaith hee,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal</hi> 32.5.</note> 
                  <hi>I confeſſed my ſinne unto the Lord, and my iniquity I have not hid.</hi> Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when a man confeſſeth his ſinne to the whole Church, this was that which the inceſtuous
<hi>Corinthian</hi> was driven unto. Thirdly, it is to the Miniſter in private, and ſuch was that of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to <hi>Iohn Baptiſt, Matth.</hi> 3.6. It is ſaid,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.6.</note> they were baptized of him in <hi>Iordan,</hi> confeſſing their
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:125641:47"/>ſinnes: ſuch alſo was that of <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Nathan,</hi> 2
<hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. Laſtly,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13.</note> it is to a mans neighbour or brother, as when a man that hath offended his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goes and confeſſes his fault, deſiring him to bee reconciled to him. This is that which our bleſſed Saviour aymes at,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.24.25. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.24.25. and which S. <hi>Iames</hi> meaneth, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.16. Now for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, whether publike or private, firſt, it is that which is commanded:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Numb</hi> 5 6.7.</note> Look into <hi>Numb.</hi> 5 7. See what God ſaith there, <hi>When a man or a woman ſhall commit any ſin, and doe a treſpaſſe againſt the Lord, and that perſon bee guilty: then they ſhall confeſſe their ſinne which they have done.</hi> Secondly, forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is promiſed to thoſe that doe confeſſe their ſinnes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13.
1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>Whoſo confeſſeth his ſinnes ſhall have mercy.</hi> And in 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.9. <hi>If wee confeſſe our ſinnes, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſinnes, and to cleanſe us from all iniquity.</hi> Thirdly, wee have examples of holy penitents going before us in this way; as <hi>David, Nehemiah, Daniel,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall, and thoſe Converts in <hi>Acts</hi> 19.18. The Text ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 19.18.</note> 
                  <hi>They confeſſed, and ſhewed their works:</hi> This confeſſion ſtandeth; Firſt, in <hi>accuſing our ſelves</hi> for our ſinnes in generall: but more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for our particular ſinnes; thus did <hi>David,</hi> 2
<hi>Sam.</hi> 12. hee accuſed himſelfe for his adultery and murder:<note place="margin">2
<hi>Sam</hi> 12.</note> and in like manner, <hi>Paul</hi> that choſen veſſell accuſes himſelfe of being a blaſphemer and a perſecuter; yea, the chiefe of ſinners, 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.15. Secondly,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.15.</note> it ſtands in a mans <hi>judging himſelfe,</hi> when hee paſſeth the ſentence of condemnation againſt himſelfe: Thus did <hi>David,</hi> he confeſſes
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:125641:47"/>that hee had done wickedly,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17.</note> 2
<hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17. and <hi>Daniel</hi> acknowledgeth that to him and his people belonged nothing but ſhame: This is to judge a mans ſelfe, which if men doe, they ſhall ſave God a labour, for hee that judgeth himſelfe, ſhall eſeape the judgement of the Lord.</p>
               <p>I deſire you to practiſe this ſecond act of <hi>Ezra;</hi> doe not only pray unto God,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> but likewiſe confeſſe your ſinnes unto him; I doe not charge on you that kinde of confeſſion which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> charge upon their people: they tye a man; Firſt, to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular enumeration and confeſſion of all his ſinnes to the Prieſt. Secondly, they ſay, if men doe not particularly confeſſe their ſinnes, they cannot obtaine pardon. But thirdly, if a man ſhall doe ſo, then hee deſerves to bee pardoned. But wee are againſt them on theſe grounds. Firſt, <hi>there is no precept in the Word of God,</hi> which commands a man to make a particular enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and confeſſion of his ſins to the Prieſt. Secondly, <hi>there is no promiſe to encourage us</hi> to doe it Thirdly, <hi>there is no example for it</hi> in the whole Book of God. Nay, I will prove that without this particular enumeration of ſinnes, remiſſion hath been granted, as to the woman which was a ſinner in the City, Chriſt pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth her pardoned without a particular enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of her ſinnes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.48.</note> 
                  <hi>Luk.</hi>
7.48. and thus hee pardoned <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> who only made a generall confeſſion of his ſinnes, and obtained remiſſion.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:125641:48"/>Secondly, wee oppoſe them herein on this ground, becauſe <hi>they charge that on people which is impoſsible,</hi> for as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12. who can underſtand his faults?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12.</note> and yet hee was better skilled in this kinde of Arithmetick then any Romaniſt: and if he could not reckon his ſinnes, no man elſe can. Our ſinnes are as the ſands upon the Sea-ſhore for multitude, which no mortall wight can number: And ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the juſt man falls ſeven times a day,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.16. Therefore it is impoſſible for any man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe all his ſinnes particularly. Thirdly, this is <hi>the wrack of the ſoule,</hi> for ſuch a man goes away without any plenary remiſſion of his ſinnes; for if it bee ſo, that hee that meanes to obtaine pardon muſt make a particular enumeration of all his ſinnes, then it is certaine that hee muſt goe away without remiſſion, becauſe it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to confeſſe all his ſinnes particularly. Laſtly, this is that which the <hi>primitive Chriſtians knew not:</hi> it was a yoake too heavie for them to beare; and one of their own ſaith, <hi>Tertullian</hi> never knew any particular confeſſion, but to the Church. Again, when it grew up in after-times, it was put down wiſely; For when a Biſhop of Conſtantinople perceived that a Prieſt under pretence of confeſſion, did with <hi>Eli</hi> his Sonnes abuſe a woman at the doore of the ſanctuary, hee preſently put it down. Againe, they of <hi>Rome</hi> make it the <hi>picklock of Kingdomes,</hi> for by this particular confeſſion, they unlock all the ſecrets of Princes I charge not this on people, but I
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:125641:48"/>wiſh them to acknowledge their ſinnes in the preſence of God: Neither is this ſo eaſie as moſt men think it to bee, for ſince our fall wee are ſo prone to conceale our ſinnes, that if there bee but one buſh in Paradiſe, wee will finde it to hide our ſelves in; but let us not hide our ſins as <hi>Adam</hi> hid himſelfe, but let us with the prodigall confeſſe them, and that is the way to have them pardoned: But ſome will demaund and ſay, how ſhall we confeſſe our ſins? To this I anſwer; Firſt, wee muſt confeſſe them, <hi>with ſhame,</hi> thus did <hi>Iob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob</hi>
42.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Iob</hi> 42.6. <hi>I abhorre my ſelfe and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> And thus did the poore Publican, he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that <hi>hee was not worthy to lift up his eyes unto Heaven.</hi> Thus alſo did the woman which was a ſinner in the City, ſhee was ſo full of ſhame for her ſinnes, that ſhee dares not come before our Saviour, but comes behinde his back as hee ſat at meat, and waſhed his feet with her teares. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, wee muſt doe it
<hi>ingenuouſly,</hi> it muſt not bee extorted from us as it was from <hi>Achan,</hi> but wee muſt willingly confeſſe our iniquities. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wee muſt doe it with <hi>ſorrow</hi> and contrition of ſoule. Fourthly, with <hi>anger.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>with honeſt hearts,</hi> that is, with an aſſured purpoſe to leave our impieties: therefore it is ſaid,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>Hee that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſinnes, ſhall finde mercy.</hi> Laſtly, wee muſt confeſſe our
<hi>ſinnes ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> there muſt bee no retaining, excuſing or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating of ſinne, for God knowes the depth of our deceitfull hearts: yee know how it is with a begger, if hee have one ſoare worſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:125641:49"/>then another, hee will bee ſute to lay that open, that hee may move paſſengers to commiſerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; So wee ſhould not only confeſſe our leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, but our groſſe iniquities, which is the next way to have God mercifull to us: Alas, what will it availe us to keep one <hi>Achan?</hi> when that one is enough to trouble a whole Hoſt; what ſhall wee gaine by reſerving one <hi>Ionah,</hi> when that one will hazard the loſſe of the ſhip, and the lives of all them that ſaile in it? Let us therefore confeſſe our ſinnes according to the manner preſcribed, and then wee may bee confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that God will forgive our iniquities, and blot out all our offences. Wee come now to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Ezra</hi> his confeſſion, laid down in theſe words, <hi>[weeping, and caſting himſelfe down before the houſe of the Lord.]</hi> The firſt thing in it, is <hi>[his weeping]</hi> and this hath ever been an uſuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant of prayer.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.6.</note> See it in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 6.6. <hi>I am weary with my groaning, all the night make I my bed to ſwimme, and water my couch with my teares.</hi> Mark, hee made his prayer to God, and teares went along with it.

                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.38. and wee ſee it in <hi>Ezra</hi> in our Text, hee not only prayes but weepes. And there is great reaſon, why wee ſhould weep in regard of ſinne:</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> Firſt, becauſe of the great good that ſin deprives us of; we are apt to grieve for the loſſe of a father,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:125641:49"/>a wife, or a child, but what great cauſe have we to mourne eſpecially for our ſinnes? though wee loſe our friends by death, yet wee may meet them againe in the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if wee live and die in Gods feare: but if we mourn not for ſinne, wee ſhall never ſee the face of God to our comfort. <hi>Micha</hi> like a fooliſh Idolater wept for the loſſe of his carved image, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 17.23 ſhall hee weep for the loſſe of that which was no God?<note place="margin">

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> Secondly, we have reaſon to weep for ſinne, becauſe of the miſeries which it brings on the Sonnes of men: Such a thing is ſinne, that it not only expoſes them to temperall judgements, but it makes them obnoxious to woes everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, even to hell fire, which is eternall: the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions which befall men here, bee not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall; though a man bee pained in divers parts of his body, yet hee is never pained all over, ſtill hee hath eaſe in ſome part or other; but in Hell men are pained in every part: Againe, while wee are here, our torment may bee miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, as if a man have a ſwelling in any part of his body, by applying a fomentation to it, hee may have eaſe; or if hee bee lame, he may bee led; but if once hee bee in Hell, hee ſhall not have ſo much as one drop of water to coole his tongue; There is no mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of paine in that place of horror, where their paines bee eaſeleſſe, endleſſe, remedileſſe, where is nothing but weeping, wailing, and

Therefore wee have good cauſe to ſhed teares; yea, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teares for our ſinnes, both in regard of the good wee loſe by them, as alſo the miſeries they bring upon us. But me thinks I heare ſome ſay, are teares neceſſarily required of all thoſe that truly repent? I anſwer no, for there bee ſome conſtitutions which afford no teares; (I have read a ſtory of one that ever laughed) and though ſuch perſons cannot burſt into teares for ſinne, yet they may inwardly as truly mourne for ſinne, as hee that ſheds rivers of teares. Secondly, though a man bee apt to teares, yet the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction may bee ſuch, that a man cannot weep: I read of one that could not but weep when his friend went to bee executed, but when his two Sonnes went the ſame way, his ſorrow was ſo great, that hee could not ſhed a teare: Great ſorrowes ſtupifie men, ſo that they be as full veſſels, which will not runne. Thirdly, wee read in the Scripture, as of teares without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as in <hi>Eſau,</hi>

                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13.</note> as in <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13. wee read not of a teare that the poore Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican ſhed, only <hi>hee ſmote his hand on his breaſt, ſaying, O God, bee mercifull to mee a ſinner:</hi> yet <hi>hee went away juſtified:</hi>

Secondly, if any can weep for the loſſe of wife, children, or any other worldly thing, and not for their tranſgreſſions, they may queſtion, whether ever their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance were ſound or no. Laſtly, if a man can weep for his ſins, no ſoule receives ſuch ſatisfaction, as that ſoule doth.</p>

They were foule ſinnes in which <hi>David</hi> was ingaged, and ſometimes they put him ſhrewdly to it, cauſing him to complain and ſay, <hi>They were a burthen too heavie for him;</hi> yet, God be thanked, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of them.

And when God would extend mercy to ſuch a finner as hee, what doth he but proclaime to the world that none ſhould deſpaire?

               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Solution.</note> this is no impeachment to the truth, which I have delivered, for I ſaid, and ſay again, If men doe repent, though their ſins were never ſo grear, they ſhall be pardoned; but the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt admits of no repentance; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if ever thou didſt ſigh for ſinne, that was not the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, for ſuch as are guilty of chat tranſgreſſion, are without all ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row &amp; remorſe: and that ſin is not irremiſſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God cannot pardon it, but becauſe that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man cannot performe the condition which God requires of him, and that is Repentance: as it is with a Patient, who ſpits in the Phyſicians face, and throwes away all good potions preſcribed him for his recovery: of ſuch a one we ſay, hee is incurable; ſo we ſay of the ſinne againſt the holy Spirit, he that commits it, becauſe hee deſpights the Spirit of God, and becauſe hee repells grace, being offered him, therefore he becomes ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durated in ſinne, that hee cannot repent.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:125641:72"/>and ſo it comes about, that it is impoſsible hee ſhould be renewed againe by repentance. The ſecond Argument they bring is this, If God ſhould forgive men groſſe ſins, upon the breach of their Covenant, hee ſhould be mutable; Not ſo, for it is peremptory with God, that men ſhould repent and be pardoned; when therefore God pardons a great ſinner upon his repentance, hee changes not, neither is there the leaſt ſhadow of change in him, but the ſinner is changed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment.

<hi>Iſrael</hi> for theſe, if thou from thy heart repent thee of them: Haſt thou been a fraudulent perſon, and a deceiver of thy brother? repent of this ſinne, and make him ſatisfaction, and thou ſhalt be pardoned, for there is hope in <hi>Iſrael</hi> even concerning this. (Beloved) the Lord hath this day ſent the greateſt of ſinners to tell you; That there was never any periſhed for want of mercy. Therefore, doe your ſinnes grieve you? repent of them; lie down at the foot of Gods Mercy-ſeat, and ſue for pardon in the Name, and for the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt: In any kinde, deſpaire not, for yet there is hope of Mercy: and to this purpoſe remember theſe things which I ſhall now tell thee; Firſt, as it was a ſinne in the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to limit Gods Power, ſo it is a ſinne to limit his Mercy: what ſinne can be imagined or committed too great for God to pardon? <hi>Cain</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:125641:73"/>did lie, when he ſaid, his ſinne was greater then could be forgiven: I read of one, that being told by the Devill, That his ſinnes were more then could be pardoned, and that he could not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, thinking thereby to make him deſpaire: ſaith he, thou unclean ſpirit, thou art a lyer, for if thou couldeſt repent, thou mighteſt be pardoned. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, think upon the infinite ſatisfaction, which our bleſſed Saviour hath made for ſinners; and he came not onely to cure green and ſmaller wounds, but great and inveterate ſoares, ſome eight, ſome twelve, ſome thirty eight yeeres old. Thirdly, think upon what kinde of Perſons God hath ſhewed mercy; as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve, David, Manaſſeh, Zaccheus, Mary Magdalene, Paul,</hi> and many others, who found mercy. Fourthly, think of this, that deſpaire is the greateſt ſinne in the world, for that wrongeth God in the chiefeſt of his attributes; to wit, his mercy, therefore the learned ſay, that <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Jidas</hi> ſinned more in deſpairing, then the one did in killing his Brother, or the other in betraying his Maſter. Laſtly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, that if thou deſpaireſt, and dieſt in that condition, thou ſhutteſt the doore of mercy upon thy ſelfe, and thou maiſt be ſure of Hell for thy portion; therefore deſpaire not in any caſe: but withall remember, that all this is promiſed thee upon the condition of thy repentance; be ſure therefore to repent ſeriouſly, and ſpeedily: Firſt, doe it ſeriouſly, God doth not love that thou ſhouldeſt only hang down thy head for a time like a bull ruſh, but thou muſt be rent within, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:125641:73"/>a broken and contrite ſpirit. Secondly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ſpeedily, it muſt not be to day for thee, and to morrow for God; I know God may and can pardon him that repents at the laſt houre: but if men deferre their repentance, out of hope of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, let them know, that hee that hath promiſed mercy to him that repents, doth not ſay, a man may repent when he will: and you that have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver felt theſe breakings of ſoul, and horrours of conſcience, you will finde one day, that there is a wide difference between the Devills tempting you to ſinne, and his afflicting you for ſinne; for when he tempts men to ſin, he tells them that the gate of mercy is ever open, and that though their ſins be never ſo great, yet they may repent for them at pleaſure; but when a man is in affliction and anguiſh of ſoul, then he multiplies his laſhes, and layes on load, telling him, That God wll ſhew mercy to none ſuch as he is; hee will tell him, that his ſinnes are more then can be forgiven, and with <hi>Jobs</hi> wife, hee will bid him curſe God, and die: therefore think of this now in time, for the Devill is never ſo ſweet in his temptations to ſin, as he is bitter at laſt in putting men on to deſpaire for ſinne.</p>

There is much conſequence in forſaking theſe darling corruptions; for many other ſinnes are retainers to them: it was the counſell and command of the King of <hi>Syria</hi> to his Captains and ſouldiers, to fight neither againſt great nor ſmall, but onely againſt the King of Iſrael: and it was good counſell: for as ſoone as they had ſlaine the King, the day was preſently their

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Ʋſe."/> It ſerves to ſtirre us up to this hard task; I call it a hard taske, becauſe a man will be content to part with many ſinnes, rather than he will leave his beloved corruption: as it is in fleaing a skin of a dead body, it comes off with eaſe till yee come to the head, but there it ſticks, and comes not off without difficulty: ſo a man peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will forſake many iniquities, but not <hi>dilect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um delictum,</hi> his beloved tranſgreſſion. See it in <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> hee was very unwilling to leave his unſanctified <hi>Olims</hi> and wicked acquaintance, when at firſt God opened his eyes; his luſts then ſaid unto him, <hi>nonne tecum erimus in aeternum?</hi> ſhall not wee be with thee for ever, who have been with thee ſo long? but yet when God fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with his grace, he caſt them all off, though he had taken never ſo much complacency in them before. And this muſt be done by us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> take it in ſome inſtances: Come to a licentious man, and preſſe on him the practiſe of divers things, and he will be content to admit of them, but if you touch his ſin of uncleanneſſe, ye touch him to the quick, and he will no longer beare with you; as in <hi>Herod, He heard John gladly, and did many things which he ſpake:</hi> but if he offer to meddle with his <hi>Herodias,</hi> his life muſt pay for his errour: ſo that ſay what man will or can, ſuch a one will not leave his filthy, yet beloved ſin: nay, ſome have proteſted, they could not
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:125641:83"/>leave their uncleanneſſe. In like manner come to an exceſſive perſon, bid him doe this or that, he will ſubſcribe unto it; but if ye ſtrike at his ſin of exceſſe, then he ſtormes and fumes, ſaying, Take away my cup, and take the club out of
<hi>Hercules</hi> hand; take away my liquour, and take away my life: he ſaith with the Vine,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Should I leave my wine, which cheareth God and man?</hi> Come to the covetous man, and he will eaſily be perſwaded to avoyd prodigality, here you ſhall finde him as tractable as may be; but yet all that you can ſay or doe, ſhall not worke upon him to forſake his covetouſnes. But notwithſtanding all this, as men take knowledge of thoſe ſinnes which domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere moſt in them, ſo they muſt forſake and leave them, yea though they be as deare unto them as <hi>Shechaniahs</hi> wife was unto him. And tell me not that this is difficult, but hearken to what our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, If thy right hand offend thee cut it off, for it is better to enter maimed into heaven, then having two hands to be caſt into hell fire. And what doſt thou telling me that they be profitable ſins? is not Godlines the beſt, nay the only gaine? and what doſt thou tell me of thy ſweet ſin of licentiouſnes? I tell thee, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaneum quod delectat, aeternum quod cruciat,</hi> it is a momentary pleaſure, and unleſſe thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it, will bring thee into eternall torments, to the utter ruine of thy ſoule &amp; body. And ſay not to me as <hi>Naaman</hi> to
<hi>Eliſha,</hi> God be mercifull to me in this or that ſin; for as one leak is enough to ſink a ſhip, ſo one ſin will damn a ſoul; and thou art far
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:125641:84"/>from mercy, if thou preferreſt a profitable or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable ſinne to thy God. I will come home to thee in a familiar reſemblance; if thou ſhouldeſt harbour a Rebell in thy houſe, and when the King ſent unto thee upon paine of death to deliver him, thou ſhouldeſt refuſe to doe it, couldſt thou expect any favour, though hee were never ſo neare or deare unto thee? even ſo, thy ſinnes be Rebells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King of heaven, no ſuch Rebells againſt his Majeſtie as they; if now at his command thou wilt not renounce them, and caſt them from thee, how canſt thou hope for mercy? there remains nothing for thee, but a fearfull expectation of wrath and vengeance to light upon thee: Away then with the bond-woman and her-ſonne, away with this <hi>Jonah,</hi> for which the whole ſhip fares the worſe: though thy ſins be as deare unto thee as thy right eye, yet caſt them from thee, becauſe they diſpleaſe God: doe not love thy ſinne, and hate thy ſoul, if thou doſt, what then wilt thou doe in the end thereof? Secondly, <hi>[they put away the children borne of them.]</hi> What was the cauſe of this? <hi>Carthuſian</hi> gives the reaſon, and it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good one, which will yeeld us the ground of an obſervation; ſaith hee, They caſt out the children with their mothers, leſt the wives ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving leſt their children behinde them, ſhould take occaſion to returne againe to fetch them: ſo that you ſee they cut off all occaſion of being again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in that tranſgreſſion: the point then is this;</p>

Thirdly, if a man doe truly tremble at Gods word, then he will at the ſame time finde in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a reſolution to amend that for which he knowes he is juſtly reproved.

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:125641:90"/>to come to practiſe all poſſible obedience, in the whole courſe of his life and converſation. And ſo much for chat point. But now, who were theſe that trembled at Gods word? ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors ſuppoſe they were ſuch as had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the forementioned ſinne, and hearing Gods word, were ſmitten with feare, becauſe of the ſtrange wives which they had maried: and if ſo, they were fit men to adviſe others who had committed the ſame ſinne, but had not repented of it: and the truth is, which ſhall be my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,</p>
